# Model title

This is a quick card about the model. There should also be a subfolder in here with the same name and model itself (if available, relevant to the UC/project (DL model preweights are interesting, random forest: meh)) 
We need to check Git LFS if we want all of it - which requries some financing...) or maybe a python/shell/url.txt with a download link or howto-download?

For later, we can also do example notebooks where we do a quick analysis of a dataset under the UCx/notebooks/ folder. We wil see how far we can get this.

For each included model, copy this file, create a new title and link to the UCx/readme.md file

Fill in the following model card:
