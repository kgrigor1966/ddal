## About The Project

Part of the [ICAERUS project](https://icaerus.eu) is to develop, maintain and optimize available drone analytical models. Theze can be image analysis, image processing, path planning, or even actuator control. If it is related to UAVs: it fits. 

This repository contains a large set of models used in drone-analytics of five different drone use-cases:
- UC1: Crop Monitoring
- UC2: Crop Spraying
- UC3: Forestry/Biodiversity
- UC4: Livestock Monitoring
- UC5: Rural Transportation

An explanation on how these models were found can be read in the [wiki](https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/ddal/wiki#models).

## Usage

To find and search models, please refer to the [ICAERUS Platform](https://icaerus-platform.eu). Alternatively, you can browse the structure of this repo, and see all the subprojects and their accessible code, and how to run them.

Furthermore, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/ddal/wiki) if you need more details and explanations on the structure, contributing, and using individual models/methods.

## Contributing

The general idea is that this serves as a central place for all the available models that are continuing to be updated during the course of the project. As such, contributions are done to the individual repo's of the models and projects. If you want to contribute to this main repo, please open an (Issue)[https://github.com/ICAERUS-EU/ddal/issues].
